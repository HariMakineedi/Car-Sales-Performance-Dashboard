# Car-Sales-Performance
##  Project Objective

The goal of this project is to visualize and analyze year-to-date car sales data using Power BI. This dashboard helps track key performance metrics such as total sales, average price, units sold, and regional performance. It also enables users to filter data by body style, color, transmission type, and dealer, supporting strategic business decisions through interactive and dynamic reporting.

##  Tools & Technologies

- **SQL** â€“ Data extraction, filtering, aggregation, and transformation  
- **Power BI** â€“ Data modeling, KPI design, interactive dashboard creation  
- **Excel** â€“ Initial data cleaning, formatting, and validation  
- **Power Query** â€“ Data shaping and preprocessing within Power BI  
- **DAX** â€“ Calculated columns and custom measures for analysis  


 ##  Project Process

### 1.  Data Collection
- Gathered car sales data in Excel format (`Car Sales.xlsx`) containing detailed attributes like region, dealer name, color, engine type, body style, and sales figures (YTD & MTD).

### 2.  Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Used **Power Query** in Power BI to:
  - Remove duplicates and null values
  - Standardize data formats (e.g., date, currency)
  - Rename columns and split/merge fields for analysis readiness

### 3.  Data Modeling
- Loaded the cleaned data into Power BI
- Created relationships between fields such as:
  - Region â†’ Dealer â†’ Sales Metrics
  - Body Style / Engine / Transmission â†’ Sales & Pricing
- Defined calculated columns and measures using **DAX**

### 4.  Dashboard Design
- Built interactive visuals including:
  - KPIs: Total Sales, Cars Sold, Avg. Price
  - Charts: Bar, Pie, Line, Column
  - Slicers: Region, Body Style, Transmission, Color
- Applied a clean, user-friendly layout with consistent formatting

### 5.  Insight Generation
- Analyzed top-performing regions and dealers
- Identified trends in customer preferences (e.g., popular colors and styles)
- Compared MTD vs YTD performance
- Highlighted strategic metrics for business decision-making

##  Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how business intelligence tools like **Power BI** can transform raw sales data into actionable insights. By analyzing year-to-date and month-to-date car sales across multiple dimensions such as region, body style, engine type, and dealer performance, the dashboard helps stakeholders monitor KPIs, spot trends, and make informed strategic decisions. The interactive visualizations offer a clear, user-friendly view of performance metrics, supporting data-driven decision-making in the automotive sales domain.
