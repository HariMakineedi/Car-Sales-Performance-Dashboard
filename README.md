# Car-Sales-Performance
##  Project Objective

The goal of this project is to visualize and analyze year-to-date car sales data using Power BI. This dashboard helps track key performance metrics such as total sales, average price, units sold, and regional performance. It also enables users to filter data by body style, color, transmission type, and dealer, supporting strategic business decisions through interactive and dynamic reporting.
